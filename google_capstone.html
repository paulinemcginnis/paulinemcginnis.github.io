    <h1>Salifort Motors employee retention project</h1>
    <center><h2>Capstone project from the <i>Google Advanced Data Analytics professional certificate</i> on Coursera</h2></center>

    <h3>Overview of the capstone project:</h3> 

    <p>Salifort Motors is a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer. Its senior leadership team is concerned about the high turnover rates the company is facing. This is very expensive for the company, because of the high costs involved in recruiting, training and upskilling employees. The leadership team would like to be able to predict whether or not an employee will leave the company, and uncover the main reasons leading them to do so, so that they can develop a solution to increase employee retention and therefore save time and money training new employees.  
The Human Resources department thus surveyed a sample of employees to learn more about their satisfaction levels with the company and what may be driving the high turnover rates. As a data specialist working for Salifort Motors in this fictitious scenario, I was tasked with analyzing the data and developing a model that could predict whether or not an employee will leave the company. </p>

    <h3>Summary of the approach and results:</h3> 

    <p>After performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to better understand the data, and analyzing trends within the data to gain insights on satisfaction levels and turnover rate, I then tested three different types of machine learning (ML) models to predict which employees were more likely to leave the company. Because the variable to be predicted is categoric and the data are labeled, the appropriate ML models for this case are either a logistic regression or a tree-based model. The logistic regression models I attempted did not perform well, so 2 tree-based ML models were used to identify employees who would leave: a Random Forest model and a model with extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Both performed very well, correctly identifying 90% of the employees who would leave. Both models identified the same main features that were contributing to employees leaving the company: the number of projects an employee takes on at a time; the length of an employee's tenure (with a peak in turnover rates at tenures of 4-6 years); how many hours per month an employee works on average; the employee's evaluation scores (with many employees with high evaluation scores leaving); and, to a lesser degree, lower salaries. With this, recommendations were made to the leadership team to improve company culture and increase employee retention, effectively saving costs on hiring new employees. </p>

    <h3>The dataset</h3> 

    <p>This project used a dataset consisting of 10 columns and 14,999 rows of self-reported information from employees, described in the table below. The dataset can be downloaded from its original source on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction?select=HR_comma_sep.csv" target='_blank'>Kaggle</a>.</p>
